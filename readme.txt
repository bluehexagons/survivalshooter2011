Survival Shooter 2011 is a very rough TypeScript port of an old Java game I worked on in my free time for a while.

This bundled version of the game is licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0.
The original TypeScript source code is proprietary, but may be available on request.
If I continue development of this project, I plan to properly open source it.

===============================================================================

Welcome to Survival Shooter, where the goal is to survive.
Unfortunately, you will not do that forever.

To move, use WASD.
To shoot, use the left mouse button.
To cycle weapons, use the Q and E keys. Notice that it highlights your active weapon in the lower-left.
Weapons that have a hollow green circle in the upper-right of their box have secondary fire modes.
Press the right mouse button to use the secondary fire.
The space key is the use key. Press it to pick up weapons, which are the white dots with numbers.
The numbers indicate which weapon they are. Hover to see their names.
The numbers in the upper left are score (difficulty), and below that your health (314.16).

Some weapons use the mouse wheel for some reason.
